I ran TPCTF with a couple friends back in 2017, when I was in middle school. The challenges were pretty bad, but somehow we managed to get 500 teams to play. If you're interested, you can view the [archived website](https://tpctf.github.io/tpctf-static-2017/), [challenges](https://github.com/tpctf/problems-2017), and [community-created writeups](https://ctftime.org/event/535/tasks/).
