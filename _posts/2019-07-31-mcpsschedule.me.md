Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Schedule.

## Background

If you go to my school district, there's a pretty good chance you've heard of [mcpsschedule.me](https://mcpsschedule.me). If you haven't, here's what it does: it scrapes your schedule from places where MCPS accidentally publishes them and compiles class rosters based on everyone who's used the site. You can then see who is in your class, as long as they've logged on to the website.

This is the perfect recipe for viral success &mdash; the more people that use the site, the more useful it is. In this post I'll go through the history of the site, as well as the technical details of each method I used. It's likely this will be the end of mcpsschedule.me, unless the [new SIS](https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/procurement/uploads/4181.1/4181.1%20Approved%20Board%20Resolution%205-14-2019.pdf) has similar issues.

## History

### July 2018

Most of these leaks come from Powerschool. This one was actually first shared on Instagram, and when I saw people asking who had shared classes I realized that it could be automated. I threw together a site in about an hour (Blair hadn't uploaded schedules yet so I couldn't test it myself), and shared it with a few people.
